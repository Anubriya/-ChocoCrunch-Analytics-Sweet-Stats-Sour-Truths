# -ChocoCrunch-Analytics-Sweet-Stats-Sour-Truths
🍫✨ A simple yet insightful Power BI project analyzing chocolate products’ nutritional profiles. Explore total products, brand diversity, NOVA classifications, and sugar &amp; calorie categories through easy-to-read cards and donut charts. Gain a quick understanding of the market’s sweet risks and make informed consumption choices.

Data workflow:

Extracted product data from the API

Cleaned data and handled missing values

Created SQL tables and inserted cleaned data

Ran SQL queries (27 queries) to extract summary metrics

Visualized results in Power BI using cards and categorical charts

📊 Visualizations

Cards: Show single-number summaries like total products, distinct brands, high-sugar products, and ultra-processed product count.

NOVA Group Donut: Shows proportion of products in each NOVA group (1–4).

Sugar Category Donut: Shows proportion of products in Low, Moderate, and High sugar categories.

Calorie Category Donut: Shows proportion of products in Low, Moderate, and High calorie categories.

All visuals use chocolate-themed colors for clarity and aesthetic appeal.

🔑 Key Insights

Majority of products are ultra-processed (NOVA 4).

High-sugar and high-calorie products form a large portion of the market.

Low and Moderate sugar/calorie products exist but are fewer.

🎯 Recommendations

✔️ Consumers should prefer chocolates in Low/Moderate sugar & calorie categories.
✔️ Awareness of NOVA classification can guide healthier choices.
